// ðŸ“„ What is subscription.model.js?
    // âœ… Purpose:
    // The subscription.model.js file defines the schema and structure for user subscriptions in your database using Mongoose.
    // This model helps track which user is subscribed to which other user, just like subscribing to a YouTube channel.

// ðŸ§  What it represents:
    // Imagine:
    // User A subscribes to User B.
    // You need to store:
    // Who subscribed (subscriber)
    // Who was subscribed to (channel)
    // When it happened (timestamp)
// ðŸ“Œ Summary for Notes:
    // subscription.model.js stores info about who subscribes to whom, allowing users to follow channels like on YouTube.
