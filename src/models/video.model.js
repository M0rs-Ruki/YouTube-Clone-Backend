// üß† What is video.model.js?
    // ‚úÖ It defines the structure (schema) for videos in your MongoDB database.
    // ‚úÖ It tells MongoDB what properties each video should have (like title, description, URL, uploader, etc.).
    // ‚úÖ It makes it super easy to create, find, update, and delete videos using Mongoose methods.

// üì∫ Think of it like this:
    // video.model.js is telling MongoDB:
    // "Hey! Every video should have a title, video file URL, and should belong to a user who uploaded it.
    // You can also keep track of views, likes, and timestamps."

// üèÅ Super Short Summary:
    // video.model.js = blueprint for all videos uploaded on your platform, 
    // including details like title, uploader, URL, views, and likes.
